# BlockingCardAnalysis

Blocking cards are an affordable device for protecting smart cards. These devices are placed close to the smart cards and generate a noisy jamming signal or shield them.
Through this repo, we release the tools we developed for inspecting the spectrum emitted by blocking cards and setting up our attack against the MIFARE Classic and the MIFARE Ultralight.
